My client on 99Freelas asked me to automate the process of transferring data from a spreadsheet to a website. I created a Python script using openpyxl, pyperclip, and pyautogui to handle this task efficiently.

My client on 99Freelas requested an automation to transfer data from a spreadsheet to a website the company uses. To solve this, I developed a Python script using the openpyxl, pyperclip, and pyautogui libraries.

The script starts by loading the Excel file using openpyxl, which allows me to read the data from specific cells in the sheet. For each product listed, the script copies the relevant data (such as product name, description, price, etc.) and uses pyperclip to copy it to the clipboard. Then, pyautogui is used to simulate keyboard and mouse actions, pasting the data into the corresponding fields on the website, replicating the process of manual data entry. This automation greatly improves efficiency by saving time and reducing human error in data transfer.

Thanks to this solution, the client can now quickly input large amounts of product data into their system without the need for repetitive manual work. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work on this project, and I hope this solution helps streamline their workflow!

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this explanation until the end!♥️
